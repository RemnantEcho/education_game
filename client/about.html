        <h1> OUR MISSION</h1> 
        <p class = "about-us">With increasing studies of student performance across all subjects, we investigated the average results for today's pupils within non-STEM subjects. There is a lack of engagement due to the perception of these subjects being <em class = "emphasis">"less important"</em>. </p>

           <p> It's important for us to understand the concepts of these subjects and we here at CTRL-FREAKS wanted to develop a method that allowed people to enhance their learning experiences with these topics.
