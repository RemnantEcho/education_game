        <h1> OUR MISSION</h1> 
        <p class = "about-us">With increasing studies of student performance across all subjects, we investigated the average results for today's pupils within non-STEM subjects. There is a lack of engagement due to the perception of these subjects being <em class = "emphasis">"less important"</em>. </p>

           <p> It's important for us to understand the concepts of these subjects and we here at CTRL-FREAKS wanted to develop a method that allowed people to enhance their learning experiences with these topics.

            <p class = "quote">“As things stand, a greater focus on STEM subjects has meant that there is less time available for us to spend on non-core subjects in particular. A result of this is that knowledge that students gain is often superficial and lacks depth.” </p>
           <p class = "quote"> “With the frequency of lessons decreasing, one of the things that we are increasingly noticing is that students are struggling to retain the knowledge that they need.”</p>
